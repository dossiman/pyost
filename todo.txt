Hi,

Not sure how much coverage I have because there are a lot of discrepancies between:
- the API calls in the RPC proto files
- the developers documentation at https://developers.iost.io/docs/en/6-reference/API/
- the JavaScript implementation
I thought the RPC API should be up to date but it seems that they have a few calls that
do not exist in the REST API and vice versa. What is the official and final reference
for all API calls? Which call should be included or excluded in the SDK?
See below for the details.
The source code is available here: https://github.com/dossiman/pyost

I have implemented and unittested the following API calls:
get /getHeight
get /getTxByHash/{hash}
get /getTxReceiptByHash/{hash}
get /getTxReceiptByTxHash/{hash}
get /getBlockByHash/{hash}/{complete}
get /getBlockByNum/{num}/{complete}
get /getBalance/{ID}/{useLongestChain}
get /getNetID
get /getState/{key}

Those are still a work in progress:
post /sendRawTx
post /estimateGas
post /subscribe

The online doc and the JS module references those calls but they are not in the RPC proto files:
get /getChainInfo
get /getNodeInfo

The JS module implements those calls but they are neither in the doc nor in the RPC API:
get /getContract
post /getContractStorage
post /sendTx

The online doc and JS module do not mention those calls that are in the RPC API:
get /getHeight
get /getState/{key}
post /sendRawTx
post /estimateGas
post /subscribe
